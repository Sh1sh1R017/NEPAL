            <p>
                Nepal's history is like a rollercoaster ride through time. It all began with ancient civilizations settling in the region, way back in the Stone Age. As the years passed, different dynasties like the Kirats, Lichhavis, and Mallas took their turns in the spotlight, bringing cultural and architectural booms. Then, in the late 18th century, the legendary Prithvi Narayan Shah swooped in and united all these scattered kingdoms and principalities, creating the Nepal we know today. But it wasn't all smooth sailing. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Nepal had its share of political struggles, even briefly being under British influence. Fast forward to 1951, there was a big revolution, leading to a more democratic monarchy. The 20th century brought its own drama, including a decade-long civil war. In 2008, Nepal waved goodbye to its monarchy and embraced a federal democratic republic. Now, it's on a journey to find its footing, balancing tradition, progress, and those stunning Himalayan peaks that keep everyone coming back for more.
